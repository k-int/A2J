a2j INSTALL file, last updated by Ian on Fri Jan  5 12:37:20 GMT 2001

The a2j distribution contains 2 jar files, a2j.jar which contains the
full distribution including the ASN to Java compiler, and a2jruntime.jar
which containst just the classes needed to make the generated codec 
classes work. The runtime is considerably smaller than the full distribution
so you are advised to distribute only that file with any applet that might
use generated codecs.

To use the runtime, simply add the a2jruntime.jar file to your classpath.

To use the complier, make sure a2j.jar is in your classpath and invoke the
compiler as described in the README.

Cheers,
Ian.
