Building applications using the generated code
----------------------------------------------

I think the eaisest thing to do is to look at the Z3950 client application that is
a part of the java toolkit (download from jzkit.sourceforge.net). Specifically,
look at com.k_int.z3950.client.ZClient and com.k_int.z3950.util.ZEndpoint.

Current notes on compiler performance / state
---------------------------------------------

Z3950
-----
Compiler seems to compile everything OK and protocol stack works ok in test system.
Currently, most interop testing done with server at bagel.indexdata.dk port 210, database GILS.

ISO10161
--------
The compiler now processes the ASN, but I have not yet tried to build an
application. Really need to check that the module level explicit tagging directive
is properly observed. Will build a test system at some point.

LDAP
----
Compiler needs work on some of the nested types, won't compile at the moment, give me a shout if
you need this to work, it's only going to take me a short while to fix.
