# A2J - A Pure Java ASN.1 to Java Precompiler and Runtime.

# About

A2J is a utility module designed to assist in the implementation of protocols such as Z39.50 and ISO10161. It was first
released in 1999 as the base library for JZKit, the first fully open source Java Z39.50 toolkit.

This repository updates A2J and replaces the legacy maven POM files with gradle build, adds unit tests and more robust project structures.
Build artefacts are published to the k-int nexus repository ( http://nexus.k-int.com/ )
